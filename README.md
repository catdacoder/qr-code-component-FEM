## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned:

- Not to fear margin property when trying to align parent elements.
- Paid attention to details like font color and box-shadowing.
- Used CSS flexbox layout to correctly align child elements.

### Continued development:

- I want to keep working on getting a better grasp of media queries and overall website responsiveness.

### Useful resources:

- [Box-shadowing] (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp)
